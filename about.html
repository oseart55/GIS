  <h1>About This Project</h1>
  <br>This is just a hobby project with the goal of making Crime Data within Nebraska easier to view.
  All of the data used in this project is Open Source, and if you would like to you can view the data
  by using the links in the "Links" section.</br>
  <br>When you make a selection in the drop down, you will see the 2000 most recent entries. Due to the limitation of ESRI's Rest Services, and me not wanting to deal with pagination, those will be the only ones that are shown. 
  However, it should be more than useable for small to medium cities.</br>
